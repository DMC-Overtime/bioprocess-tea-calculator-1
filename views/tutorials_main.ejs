                <h3>Use Cases  </h3>

                    <p><br></p>
                    <li>New Construction : This calculator should be used for projects requiring the construction of new dedicated plants for the production
                    of chemicals using bioprocesses. Estimates of captial costs  for new plant construction are based on brownfield assumptions. (See below).
                    With this calculator, the minimum annual production capacity considered for a new facility is 1kta ( 1 kilotonne per annum/year) or alternative 1,000,000 kg of
                    a chemical product per year. Processes resulting in annual production volumes lower than this should not use these estimates. Additionally,
                    for products at the low end of these production volumes, contract manufacturing (leveraging existing facilities, rather than building
                    a new plant) may be commerically viable. The current version of this calculator assumes new construction. </li>

                     <p><br></p>
                    <li>Production Volumes: As mentioned this calculator should be used for processes producing anywhre from 1 to 100kta of a chemical.
                    This equates to 1,000,000 to 100,000,000 kg per year.  The use should assess whether the volumes considered by this calculator are
                    meaningful in light of the market size for a given product. For example, if the current worldwide annual production is lower than 1 kta
                    , this calculator is likely not appropriate.  </li>

                     It is important to note that the current capital cost estimates are for Brownfield site develop. This assumes that the plant is
                     added to a site with current industrial development. Costs of real estate, as well as the costs to install equipment to generate
                     utilites or waste water treatement are not included in these capital estimates.</li>

                    <p><br></p>
                    <li> Product Tyeps: The current version of the Bioprocess TEA calculator enables users to evaluate the
                      biosynthetic production of a wide variety of organic chemicals. Currently priducts are limited to those containing
                      carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms. There is currently no support for chemicals with a wider variety of functional groups
                      such as those containing sulfur or other heteroatoms. This functionality may be added in the future. </li>

                    <li>Sugar Sources: The current version of the calculator assumes glucose (dextrose) as the carbon and electron source
                    for the production of any given target chemicals. Future variants may include additional feedstocks. Please feel free to request
                    a new feedstock in the discussion board.</li>
